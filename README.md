How to setup server and client for testing:

Firstly, make sure that Python and pip3 are installed on your computer. You will need pip3 to install the needed libraries.

Then you need to copy the repository to your computer.

Once that is done, you need to install the required libraries with pip3. To do that, open the shell of your OS, use cd to go to the location of the repository. In the repository should be a file called requirements.txt. That file contains the names of the libraries. To install them, make sure that you are in the right directory. Then type in the command 'pip3 install -r requirements.txt'. 

Then, to start up the server and client, go to their respective directories (start with the server). If you're on a Unix platform, you should be able to use the command 'python3 Server.py'. If you're on Windows, use the command 'py server.py -3'. Then open up a new shell window for the client. Then on Unix, use 'python3 TextMMO.py' and 'py TextMMO.py -3' on Windows.
